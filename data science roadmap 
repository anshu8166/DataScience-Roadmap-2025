Projects:
Credit Card Fraud Detection using Autoencoders in Keras | TensorFlow for Hackers Assess credit risk by applying probability distributions and statistical analysis on credit card data.This project employs autoencodersâ€”a type of neural networkâ€”to detect fraudulent credit card transactions. By learning the patterns of normal transactions, the autoencoder can identify anomalies that may indicate fraud. This approach leverages unsupervised learning, making it effective even when labeled fraudulent data is scarce.

Predictive Maintenance using Machine Learning by Medini Kumar Bora This project focuses on predicting equipment failures before they occur, allowing for timely maintenance and reduced downtime. By analyzing historical sensor data and operational metrics, machine learning models can forecast potential issues, optimizing maintenance schedules and extending equipment lifespan.

Customer Segmentation using K Means: A Step by Step Guide by Leonardo A This project utilizes K-Means clustering to segment customers based on shared characteristics. By identifying distinct customer groups, businesses can tailor their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and enhance overall profitability. The iterative process of training, testing, and tweaking ensures the model's effectiveness.

Harvestify Github Harvestify is a machine learning-based website that assists farmers by recommending the best crops to cultivate, suitable fertilizers, and diagnosing crop diseases. By inputting specific parameters, users receive data-driven suggestions, promoting efficient farming practices and potentially increasing yields.

Machine Learning for Retail Demand Forecasting by Samir Saci This project compares different methods for forecasting retail demand, specifically contrasting XGBoost models with rolling mean approaches. Accurate demand forecasting enables retailers to optimize inventory levels, reduce stockouts, and enhance customer satisfaction. The study provides insights into the effectiveness of machine learning techniques in retail settings.
